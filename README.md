# YT Views

YT Views is a simple Google Chrome extension that keeps a track of the watch frequencies of different YouTube videos!

Note: 
1. This extension was made by a non-JavaScript developer in a single day of hacking, and so, is prone to bugs and "bad practices"! 

2. I do not have enough money to put it up in the Chrome Web Store. So, to use it, one would need to follow instructions specified here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24577660/7969717
